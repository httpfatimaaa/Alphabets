# Measuring the Complexity of Written and Molecular Alphabets

Various human languages transmit information by encoding it in written alphabets (for example, the one being used here). The symbols (letters, but also numerals in math) in these alphabets must be able to represent all of the vocal phonemes or conceptual units which the language needs to be intelligible, and are generally arbitrary, though sometimes they descend from earlier pictographs. These symbols need to be distinguishable among themselves, which implies they have significant and easily discernible structural differences (e.g., "0" vs. "1", "v" vs. "w"). The complexity and differences among these symbols can be quantified by various metrics, as can the processes needed to construct them (such as the number of writing strokes or stroke order). Similarly, biology uses molecular alphabets, most notably the nucleobases and amino acids, which are used to construct biopolymers (polynucleotides and proteins). In contrast with written language, these symbols are three dimensional and have specific functional properties, so the metrics which make these symbols unique may be different, or there may be deep structural similarities in the ways systems select symbolic alphabets. This project aims to develop complexity metrics for both human linguistic and biological molecular alphabets, compare their distributions, and understand how information is compressed into structure and selected for functional use in alphabets.
